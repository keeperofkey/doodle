# Nomenclature: Seeing Is Forgetting the Name

## Senior Thesis Show

### 2018

Language is intrinsically tied to our perception of the world around us. The
words we use to describe the things we see shape our understanding and
experience of them. In his seminal work "Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the
Thing One Sees," artist Robert Irwin explored this profound connection between
language and visual perception.

"Nomenclature" is an immersive installation that
invites viewers to confront the complex interplay between the act of seeing
and the act of naming. As we move through the space, our senses are confronted
with a kaleidoscope of sights, sounds, and words that challenge the boundaries
of our linguistic frameworks.

At times, the installation presents us with familiar objects and environments,
only to disrupt our expectations by stripping away their associated labels. In
other moments, we are confronted with abstract forms and unfamiliar textures,
prompting us to grapple with the limitations of our vocabulary to describe the
indescribable.

Through this disorienting and thought-provoking experience, "Nomenclature"
encourages us to question the assumptions and biases embedded within our
language. It prompts us to consider the ways in which our words can both
clarify and obscure our understanding of the world around us.

Embrace the fluidity of perception and the malleability of language. It
challenges us to let go of our reliance on rigid definitions and to embrace the
beauty and complexity of the ineffable.

Step into "Nomenclature" and embark on a journey that will forever alter your
relationship with the words that shape your reality.

# Mind Your Head

"Mind Your Head" is an immersive art installation that invites visitors to
embark on a meditative journey through a captivating interplay of natural forms
and architectural elements. Crafted from rough-cut pine, the installation
unfolds as a series of planks resting against the wall, gradually evolving into
a sprawling, organic structure that encompasses the entire space.

At first glance, the installation appears as a simple arrangement of wooden
planks, but as visitors move through the space, they are enveloped by a
wave-like form that undulates and branches out, reminiscent of the intricate
patterns found in nature. The rough texture of the pine adds a tactile
dimension, inviting visitors to trace the grain with their fingertips and
connect with the raw, earthy essence of the material.

As the installation expands, it takes on a tree-like quality, with branches
reaching upwards and outwards, creating a canopy that filters the surrounding
light.

"Mind Your Head" encourages visitors to slow down, breathe deeply, and immerse
themselves in the meditative space created by the installation. The undulating
forms and organic shapes invite contemplation, prompting visitors to reflect on
their own connection to the natural world and the rhythms that govern our
lives.

Through this captivating fusion of art, architecture, and nature, "Mind Your
Head" offers a sanctuary for introspection and a reminder to be mindful of the
present moment, to embrace the beauty that surrounds us.
